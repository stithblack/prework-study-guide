# <UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This application is a study guide for topics covered in the prework assignments for the UNC Coding Bootcamp. It helps me organize some of the information I've learned thus far and serves as a framework for future material I want to study. While working on this project, I learned a little more about the Git versioning flow, particularly about commands and their intended functions. I also learned more about GitHub, specifically branching and pull requests.
